    "body": "# Release v2.13.2\r\n\r\nRelease date: 2025-08-15\r\n\r\nChangelog (selected):\r\n\r\n- Fix: Ensure log rotation leaves an active `deadlink.log` file after rotation to avoid missing log file edge-cases (fixes CI test).\r\n- Fix: Allow running in `dev-mode` when Discord token is not configured (prevents demo-mode child process from exiting early during integration tests).\r\n- Tests: Verified `__tests__/demo.integration.test.js` and `__tests__/log-utils.test.js` pass across test matrix.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n- These are small, backward-compatible fixes; production behavior is unchanged when running in live mode.\r\n"
